Hello, and welcome to my blog! My name is **Jan "yaneX" Kliszcz**, and I'm a .NET developer with over three years of professional experience. In my current job, I specialize in creating internal integrations and automating tasks and processes across various departments. While I mainly work on ASP.NET-based projects, I also enjoy exploring DevOps to improve deployment processes.

I've had my first contact with programming when I was 14 and Minecraft was all the rage, I wanted to make my own mod. But let's be real, calling it a *"mod"* was a bit of a stretch. All I did was copy and paste some of the original game's tools and then modify the graphics using Paint. Looking back on it now, it's pretty *cringe-worthy*.

Later on, when I tried to get into medical studies *(with no success)*, I went to the **Wrocław University of Science and Technology** to study **Automatic Control and Robotics**. After three semesters and an arduous struggle with programming in C/C++, I've decided that there is **no way** I'll be working as a software developer in the future.

Well ... before 3rd year began, I've started learning C#. And I've absoultelty *loved it*.

I've also been a member of [EKA.NET](https://www.facebook.com/ekadotnet/), a student organization focused on promoting Microsoft technologies, mainly .NET and Azure. During my time there I've helped organizing courses for students, IT Academic Days and a hackathon in cooperation with **PGS Software** (currently as a part of Xebia capital group).

### Okay ... so what this blog is about?

In this blog, my primary goal is to share my knowledge on programming in C# and continuously learn new things along the way. While I don't consider myself an expert just yet, I have a passion for helping others navigate the challenging waters of programming at the beginning of their journey.

**But wait, there is more!**

As much as I enjoy programming, my other passion is cooking. So, if you're looking for some inspiration for your next meal, I'll occasionally be sharing some tasty recipes that are definitely worth trying!
